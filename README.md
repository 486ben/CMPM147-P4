<h1>P4. Star War</h1>
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.....
REMAKE A NEW HOPE!

I would like to create a scene of star war 4 when luke and his army fight against the darth vader(emperor). Therefore, my scene will be more like a space battle war. Thank you! The blue spaceship is the darth vader(emperor side) and the red color spaceship is my draw for the luke skywalker spaceship.

<h2> The target</h2>
My target behavior for this project was each side spaceship is chase other. Sometimes, You may see the emperor's spaceship is chase(you can understand as following them)the Revolutionary's spaceship. Sometimes, You may see revolutionary 's spaceship is chase the emperor's spaceship. Both side are battle and chase each other but not destory them(lol, I did not have time to build on details. XD)
<h2>The Flock/swarm</h2>
<li>The Blue Spaceship(emperor)</li>
<li>The Red Spaceshuip(luke)</li>
<li>The Yellow Star</li>
<li>The Explosion</li>

<h2>At least two additional object types</h2>
<li>The Death Star</li>
<li>The Yellow Star</li>
<li>The Explosion</li>

<h2>Two Additional behaviors effect for my scene</h2> 
<h3>(Professor Asiiah Song say is incorrect, so I give up. no enough time.)</h3>
I create two group of the spaceship. One is the emperor side and other one is the army who against the emperor. For two additional effect, I chose the option "some other individual behavior". If you look careful, you will found out: In the group of yellow start. Some of the yellow star will moving around. Each yellow star will have their own movement road. Other group behaviors is explosion effect(on the middle) That's is assume the battle and a spaceship have been destory. because the explosion effect is a from inside to outside, so I add some detail that look like explosion effect.

<h2>Artist statement</h2>
In this p4, I learned the idea for Flock/swarm and the behavior. I also try to o achieve my goal and I think I did it. In some way, I achieve my goal by remake my favourite movie STAR WAR 4. I draw the spaceship and deathstar also get some idea online to achieve. when I combine them. it look okay. In some way, the project spend a lot of time and does not achieve the goal because it is diffcult to draw a death star. I think the the difficulty/limitation are the time and details. which I can just simply draw the shape and less detain on it. If I can have more time on this project, I will draw the detail and give more details on it. I also want to create more explosion effect, since I create a lot of star and movement, I guess this is not a great idea to add too many explosion effect and will cause my scene become messy.
