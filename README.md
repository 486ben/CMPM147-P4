<h1>P4. Star War</h1>

I would like to create a scene of star war 4 when luke and his army fight against the darth vader(emperor). Therefore, my scene will be more like a space battle war. Thank you! The blue spaceship is the darth vader(emperor side) and the red color spaceship is my draw for the luke skywalker spaceship.

<h2>At least two additional object types</h2>
<li>The Death Star</li>
<li>The Yellow Star</li>

<h2>Spaceship's behavior for Alignment, Coherence, and Separation</h2>
