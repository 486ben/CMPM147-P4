<h1>P4. Star War</h1>

I would like to create a scene of star war 4 when luke and his army fight against the darth vader(emperor). Therefore, my scene will be more like a space battle war. Thank you! The blue spaceship is the darth vader(emperor side) and the red color spaceship is my draw for the luke skywalker spaceship.

<h2>At least two additional object types</h2>
<li>The Death Star</li>
<li>The Yellow Star</li>
<li>The Explorsion</li>

<h2>Two Additional behaviors effect for my scene</h2>
I create two group of the spaceship. One is the emperor side and other one is the army who against the emperor. For two additional effect, I chose the option "some other individual behavior". If you look careful, you will found out that some of the yellow star will keep moving. Each yellow star will have their own movement. I also create a explosion effect(on the middle) That's is assume the battle and a spaceship have been destory.
